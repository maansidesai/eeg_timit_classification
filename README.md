Authors: Maansi Desai & Garret Kurteff

With encoding being a relative strength for EEG analysis of speech features, we present a preliminary investigation 
of using an encoding-decoding framework to classify EEG responses to a set of ten sentences during a passive listening task. 
Future directions of this work help to motivate using EEG for portable BCI, and implementing recent success of encoding-decoding frameworks 
in other electrophysiological modalities (intracranial EEG and MEG).
